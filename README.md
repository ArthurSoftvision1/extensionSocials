**This add-on injects JavaScript into web pages. The `addons.mozilla.org` domain disallows this operation, so this add-on will not work properly when it's run on pages in the `addons.mozilla.org` domain.**

## What it does ##

The extension includes:

* a content script
* a background-script
* manifest.json file

When a user inserts a letter in the input section, a value will be returned.

## What it shows ##

* inject a content script programmatically using messaging system between content-script and background-script
* send a message from the main extension to a content script
* use web accessible resources to enable web pages to load packaged content
